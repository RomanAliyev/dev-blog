# Playing of looping video with AVPlayerLayer and AVPlayerLayer

Found a better way to implement video loop.

- Implement custom view to output video content.

```swift
class VideoPlayerView: UIView {
    override class var layerClass: AnyClass {
        AVPlayerLayer.self
    }
    
    var playerLayer: AVPlayerLayer {
        super.layer as! AVPlayerLayer
    }
}
```

- Instantiate  ```AVQueuePlayer``` and connect it to the ```playerLayer```:

```swift
let player = AVQueuePlayer()
videoPlayerView.playerLayer.player = player
```

- Implement looping playback.

```swift
let playerItem = AVPlayerItem(url: videoURL)
let looper = AVPlayerLooper(player: player, templateItem: playerItem)
somebody.looper = looper // keep link to the looper
```

- Pause the player when app is no longer active:

```swift
func applicationWillResignActive() {
    player.pause()
}
```

- Restore playback when app becomes active:

```swift
func applicationDidBecomeActive() {
    player.play()
}
```

- call ```player.play()```. That's it.


## Note

Sometimes 1 px lines may appear on the top or sides of the video. This code helps to workaround the problem:

```swift
videoPlayerView.playerLayer.shouldRasterize = true
videoPlayerView.playerLayer.rasterizationScale = UIScreen.main.scale
```
