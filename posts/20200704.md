# Shake animation with CAKeyframeAnimation

Let's use ```CAKeyframeAnimation``` to implement shake animation step by step:

- Instantiate ```CAKeyframeAnimation``` and state that we change the X offset of some view:

```swift
let animation = CAKeyframeAnimation(keyPath: "transform.translation.x")
```

- We need key points of the graph that represents change of the value over time. We should get them from the designer. For shake animation it may look as follows:

| time, sec | X offset, points |
|:-:|:-:|
|0|0|
|0.1|5|
|0.2|-5|
|0.3|5|
|0.4|-5|
|0.5|0|

```swift
animation.duration = 0.5
animation.keyTimes = [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1]
animation.values = [0, 5, -5, 5, -5, 0]
```

- Also ask designer about timing functions between the points. It would be great if they are standard functions (```linear```, ```easeIn```, ```easeOut``` or ```easeInEaseOut```).

```swift
animation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: .easeInEaseOut)
```

- Finally play the animation:

```swift
someView.layer.add(animation, forKey: nil)
```
